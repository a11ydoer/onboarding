Welcome to the W3C {{ group.name }}, known as ID CG.

The ID CG is an informal place where everyone is welcome to share their ideas, to pitch in and work, to provide different perspectives, or simply to listen.

Everyone who is involved in ID CG is expected to behave in accordance with the W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (CEPC):
https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/

We have a regular call on Tuesdays at 2PM UTC (7AM PT, 10AM ET, 3PM UK, 4PM CET, 10PM CST), on the 1st and 3rd week of each month. Details for the call will be sent to the ID CG email list before the meeting.

We're working on different actions, and you can explore them and contribute to discussions here:
https://github.com/w3c/idcg/issues/

We have two email lists that you've been added to automatically: public-idcg@w3.org and internal-idcg@w3.org. The first is where most of our discussions (other than those on Github) happen, the second is for discussions that we want to keep just between members of the CG.

If you have any questions, you are welcome to contact Léonie or Coralie at any time.

Léonie and Coralie, ID CG co-chairs.
