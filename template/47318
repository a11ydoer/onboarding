Welcome to the W3C {{ group.name }}!

The Working Group does most of its work on
Github, with each of our specifications developed in its own repository
(as listed in https://www.w3.org/PM/Groups/repositories.html?gid={{ group.id }}).

If you plan to contribute changes to the specifications by providing
pull requests, please link your Github and W3C accounts at:
  https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/connectedaccounts

In addition, the Working Group uses its public mailing lists for
administrative announcements and coordination on topics which require
broader attention:
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webrtc/
As a participant to the Working Group, you have been automatically
subscribed to that mailing list.

The group meets in video conferences roughly on a monthly basis; the
exact date and times are determined based on Doodle polls we run a few
weeks in advance of the said call.
https://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/wiki/Main_Page#Meetings

The group usually meets face-to-face once or twice a year, but given the
current circumstances, it is not clear when we might next meet F2F.

The current focus of the Working Group is on finishing the 3 following
specifications before the end of 2020:
* WebRTC 1.0 https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/webrtc.html
* Media Capture and Streams
https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html
* WebRTC Stats https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-stats/


https://w3c.github.io/Guide/participant/group.html?gid={{ group.id }}
is a complete map of useful resources for new participants in this group.

Should you have any question on how to get back up to speed with the
Working Group, please get in touch with the Staff Contacts of the group:
Dominique HazaÃ«l-Massieux <dom@w3.org>
Carine Bournez <carine@w3.org>

Again, warm welcome to the group and to W3C!
